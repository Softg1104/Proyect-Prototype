    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <p>The goal is promoting resource efficiency, reducing waste, and encouraging sustainable practices across all
      levels of production and consumption. As well as acknowledging the social inequalities that lie at the core of
      this problem.</p>

      <h2>The problem we are trying to solve</h2>
      <p>Nowadays everything is standardized to reduce costs and programmed to be obsolete. The biggest social problems
        that come with this problem are labor exploitation and economic inequality. While companies profit, many workers
        and small-scale producers struggle to meet basic needs this way exacerbating global inequalities and limiting
        access to resources and opportunities for marginalized groups.</p>

    <section id="awareness">
      <h2>Raise awareness</h2>
      <p>We aim to raise awareness and inspire more thoughtful consumption behaviors. It's only by questioning and
        redefining our consumption habits and patterns that we can hope to build and go towards a more sustainable
        future for all.We think that our generation finds ourselves in the middle of this problem, we were born already
        in a consumerist society but also we are paying the environmental consequences of this unethical lifestyle. The
        system we are living creates new desires and needs</p>

      <h2>What can we do as consumers</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Choose sustainable products</h3>
          <p>Opt for goods made from environmentally friendly materials, such as organic, recycled, or biodegradable
            options. Look for certifications like Fair Trade, which ensure that products are ethically produced.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Support local and ethical Brands:</h3>
          <p>Prioritize buying from businesses that are transparent about their supply chains and who treat their
            workers fairly. By supporting local brands, you can reduce your carbon footprint and help boost your local
            economy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Buy less, buy better:</h3>
          <p>Instead of focusing on quantity, invest in quality products that are durable and designed to last. This
            reduces waste and ensures that the items you buy are worth the investment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Educate yourself and others</h3>
          <p>Share knowledge about the importance of conscious consumption with your community. Encourage others to
            think critically about the impact of their purchasing decisions and how they can contribute to positive
            change.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Mindfulness on resource consumption</h3>
          <p>In addition to thoughtful purchasing, being conscious of how we use energy, water, and other resources in
            our daily lives is crucial. Simple steps like turning off unused lights or conserving water can have a
            significant impact.</p>
